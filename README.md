## Introduction

**Project Iost** is a C# Windows Forms inventory management system (IMS) designed for small businesses, warehouses, or anyone who needs robust inventory control with MySQL backend support. With Project Iost, you can create, view, edit, and delete inventory records, manage supply orders and purchases, and benefit from a comprehensive management interface built for real-world efficiency. The project also includes Python migration scripts for database setup and updates.

## Database Setup & Migrations

1. **Install XAMPP:**
   - Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and start the MySQL service.

2. **Configure MySQL:**
   - Set up a MySQL user and password (update credentials in your C# app and scripts as needed).

3. **Run Migration Scripts:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the `Migrations/` directory:
     ```
     cd Migrations
     ```
   - Execute the migration script using Python:
     ```
     python migrate.py
     ```
   - This will set up required tables and initial data in your MySQL database.

   > **Note:** You may need to update MySQL connection settings within `migrate.py` to match your environment.
